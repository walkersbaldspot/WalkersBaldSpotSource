<p>Scott Walker was working on his kitchen sink, bumped his head, and through a
  a freak accident with kitchen ingredients, a bald spot was born. During this
  tragic encounter, Scott Walker's Bald spot found it had a mind of it's own!</p>

<p>The Bald Spot Born decided it could  not stand by and let Scott Walker and his
  the string pulling  Koch Brothers take over America. The Bald Spot battles against
  his "meat puppet" throughout the Governor's journies as it fights for truth, justice and the
  American way!</p>
